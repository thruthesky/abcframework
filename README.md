# Angular Builder for Cordova

`abc` cli will give you a great convenient  build Angular app into Cordova Android, iOS and browser app.



# TODO

@refer [ABC framework git issue](https://github.com/thruthesky/abcframework/issues)

* How will Angular handle SEO?
    * at worst, use [Backend](https://github.com/thruthesky/backend)

* internet connection check thru javascript.

# Changes


## 0.4


* `abc init` is gone.







# Updating existing ABC project.

* Install new ABC project.
* Just copy src folder of OLD project into new project.



# Installation

````
$ npm install -g abcframework
````
For Linux/Mac users may need root permisson.

# Update

````
$ npm update -g abcframework
````
For Linux/Mac users may need root permisson.




# ABC

As of 0.3.x, ABC only focus on debugging.
So, when you run ABC, it automaitically does livereloading.



## Options

* `-h, --help` shows help message.
* `-d, --debug` shows debug message.
* `--bash-href` changes BASE HREF="....".
* `--address` is the address where local desktop test webserver is running. Cordova app will connect to this address.
    * default address is
        * 'localhost' for browser and ios
        * '10.0.2.2' for andriod
    
* `--port` is the port of the local desktop server port.


To change base-href, add `--base-href ...`

$ abc run browser --base-href ./

Run on 'browser' platform with <BASE HREF='./'>



* `--aot` compiles as in AoT.

To do aot, add `--aot` option.

````
$ abc run browser --aot --base-href ./
````

* `--dry` does not install npm modules

It is useful when you do installation test.

````
$ abc new a2 --dry
````



## Usecase

### Create a new project

````
$ abc new project-name
````

### Serving it to browser

````
$ ng serve
````

### Serving it to device; Run app into device with live reload.

````
$ cordova platform add browser
$ cordova platform add android
$ cordova platform add ios

$ abc run android --address=10.0.2.2:3000       // From the view of android device, you need to connect to 10.0.2.2:3000 to get to the local desktop server.
$ abc run android --address=10.0.2.2:3000 -d    // run with debug message.
$ abc run browser --address=localhost:3000      // From the view of browser, you need to connect to localhost:3000 to get to the local desktop server.
$ abc run ios --address=localhost:3000          // From the view of iOS emulator, you need to connect to localhost:3000 to get to the local desktop server.
````

* Before you do `abc run android ...`, you need to run Android emulator or connect a Android device.
* If you do `abc run ios ...`, iOS emulatory may run automatically on MacOS.

The above exmaple uses default 'base href' but other resources like css, js comes from 'http://10.0.2.2:3000' where the local desktop server is running.



# Desktop Server Connection

* If you have nginx webserver on your desktop and you want to access it from Android emualtor, you can just access through "http://10.0.2.2/..."

For instance, you have a "Backend" running on your desktop, you need to set web server to accept IP as server name(domain) and let the webserver to point the root directory to backend.

and on your Angular code, simple set the url of "Backend"
````
backend.setBackendUrl("http://10.0.2.2/index.php");
````




# Things to know


* one platform may work as live reload for case like below.
    * abc run android
    * quit
    * abc run ios
    * then, when you edit source code, android will do live-reload as ios do.
